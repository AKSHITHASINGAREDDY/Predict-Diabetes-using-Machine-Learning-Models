# Predict-Diabetes-using-Machine-Learning-Models

## Libraries used:
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
Flask

## Applications used:
Jupyer Notebook
Python Idle(3.9 64 bit)

## Dataset
PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset

## Procedure of Proposed Methodology- 

Step1:  Import required libraries, Import diabetes dataset. 

Step2:  Pre-process the data to remove all the null values and missing data. 

Step3: Perform a percentage split of 80% to divide the dataset as Training set and 20% to Test set. 
 
Step4: Select the machine learning algorithm i.e. KNearestNeighbour, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes  algorithm. 

Step5:  Build the classifier model for the mentioned machine learning algorithm based on the training set.  

Step6:  Test the Classifier model for the mentioned machine learning algorithm based on the test set. 

Step7: Perform Comparison Evaluation of the experimental performance results obtained for each classifier. 

Step8: After analyzing based on various measures conclude the best performing algorithm. 

Step9: Finally build and Host a Flask Web app. 

Step10: A user has to put details like Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI, DiabetesPedigree Function, 
Skin Thickness, Glucose Level etc
